Land Mapping Python Package

Built as a complement to the 2024-25
[Earth Data Analytics](https://github.com/byandell-envsys/EarthDataAnalytics)
course taught through the
[Earth Lab](https://earthlab.colorado.edu/).
Special thanks to [Elsa Culler](https://eculler.github.io/) as well as
[Nate Quarderer](https://github.com/nquarder),
[Lilly Jones-Sanovia](https://github.com/yawapi),
and
[Alison Post](https://akpost21.github.io/).

Interestingly, Earth Lab members developed a Python package a few years ago,
[earthpy](https://earthpy.readthedocs.io)
([GitHub repo](https://github.com/earthlab/earthpy)).
It seems fairly self-contained, but stopped development in 2021.
For instance, is uses
[rasterio](https://github.com/rasterio/rasterio),
which seems to now be superceded by
[rioxarray](https://corteva.github.io/rioxarray).
Still there are some interesting ideas here.

This is somewhat a companion to by R package
[landmapr](https://github.com/byandell-envsys/landmapr).
They are being developed in parallel, with somewhat different goals.
